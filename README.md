# sign-up-form-TOP

Sign up form project from TOP

Note: Create account validation is not perfect, the ones that work are password and confirm password input fields. Introducing invalid information on the other input fields still lets you create an account. Will fix at a later date.

Note-2: Media query at styles.css needs a lot of work, just made it so the page is somewhat readable at 600px or less.

Pseudocode:

1. Setup divs for background section, form section, header and footer.

2. Add content to the header.

3. Populate the form with inputs.

4. Add a button and paragraph to footer.

5. Background image on the background div.
